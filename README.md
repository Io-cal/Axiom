# Axiom
FPS Unlocker and Booster for ROBLOX

This **WILL** flag your antivirus as it changes actual ROBLOX files to increase FPS, and will boost FPS until the next weekly ROBLOX update, as then it gets reset. Once that happens, all you need to do is run the application again and it will delete said textures again, boosting your fps! 

This does not harm your PC in any way, nor will it harm your ROBLOX either, it simply just **deletes unneccessary texture files** that will help with boosting fps.
