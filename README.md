# Axiom - FPS Unlocker and Booster for ROBLOX

I made this as a small little private project for me and my friends, but I decided it was good enough to be shown to the world, unfortunately, I have not got around to doing any automation with this project, and will need to be ran weekly for consistent changes (and also kept open for the unlocker), potentially in the future I will update this and get it to automate, but not at the moment.




This **WILL** flag your antivirus as it changes actual ROBLOX files to increase FPS, and will boost FPS until the next weekly ROBLOX update, as then it gets reset. Once that happens, all you need to do is run the application again and it will delete said textures again, boosting your fps! 

This does not harm your PC in any way, nor will it harm your ROBLOX either, it simply just **deletes unneccessary texture files** that will help with boosting fps.
